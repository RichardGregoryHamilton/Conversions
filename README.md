# Conversions

Conversions is a gem I built that is useful for performing unit conversions. It is useful if you have measurements, and
would like to convert to another unit. This gem converts units of distance, temperature, cooking and weight.

# Installation

To install the gem, you can run

`gem install conversions`

Or add the gem to your gemfile

    gem 'conversions', '~1.0.0'
    
and run `bundle`

You can also run this in `IRB` by typing in

    require 'conversions'

# Use

This gem lets you convert distances, amount of ingredients, temperatures or even weights.

First set up a new instance of what you're trying to convert.

    @temperature = Temperature.new(60)
    
This will automatically create a new temperature object which is initialized to 60 degrees farenheit. If you want to create a
temperature object in celsius, try this instead

    @temperature = Temperature.new(60, "celsius")
    
You can convert a temperature to farenheit or to celcius
    
      @temperature.to_celsius
      @temperature.to_farenheit
        
## Distance
  
You can also convert between distances.
  
      @distance = Distance.new(100)
      
Initializes a new distance object for 100 miles. You can specify any unit you want though.

    @distance = Distance.new(100, "meters")
    
If you wanted to learn how many feet that is, you could do
    
    @distance.to_feet
    
## Cooking

This gem is useful if you are building a cooking website. You could convert something from teaspoons to tablespoons for example.

    @cooking = Cooking.new(4)
    
This defaults to 4 tablespoons, but once again, you can specify a unit

    @cooking = Cooking.new(4, "teaspoons")
    
There are a wide variety of methods to convert to. For example, you could try converting to cups.

    @cooking.to_cups
    
## Weight

You can also convert between different units of weight.

First initialize a new weight object.

    @weight = Weight.new(100)
    
This initializes a new weight object set at 100 pounds. But you can specify whichever unit you like.

    @weight = Weight.new(75, "kilograms")
    
You can convert this weight to pounds with

    @weight.to_pounds
